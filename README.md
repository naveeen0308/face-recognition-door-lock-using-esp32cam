# Face Recognition Door Lock using ESP32

## üìñ Introduction
As our society becomes more interconnected, the need for efficient and secure ways to protect our homes and businesses becomes paramount. Traditional keys can be lost, copied, or stolen. Pin codes can be forgotten or observed. But what if the key to your door was something you always had with you, something unique‚Äîand that is nothing but your face/biometrics.

In the era of smart homes and digital security, the **Face Recognition Door Lock using ESP32 CAM** offers a unique, secure, and hands-free access control method. At the heart of our system is the ESP32 microcontroller, which is used for capturing the person.
